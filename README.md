## Introduction
The intention of this project is to predict the selling price of the home in different areas
located in bangalore city.It is helpful for both home buyers and property investors for predicting the
accurate price of a home in different localities

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites

[how to install jupyter notebook](https://speedysense.com/install-jupyter-notebook-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

*NOTE*:-The above installation for those who have Ubuntu OS 18.04

[how to install Python Flask](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-flask)

***
## Technology and tools 
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

## Experimental Evaluation :-
### A. Methodology
The following are the steps that are involved in building of our model
1. Collectiong data
2. Data cleaning
3. Feature Engineering
4. Outlier removal
5. One hot encoding
6. Model building

After successful building of our model we use Use K Fold cross
validation to measure accuracy of our LinearRegression model.And
later using the gridsearch for we finding best model.in this grid search
we check accuracy of using Lasso algorithm and Decision tree
regression then we get more accuracy in linear regerssion compared
to other so we are going to use linear regressionAnd later we build user
interface website and a python flask server where we can deploy our
model ,which respond to the request form the user .
